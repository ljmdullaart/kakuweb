# It is now possible to switch on/off with calls to Domoticz.
# Use 'domo' followed by a pattern to initiate the on/off call.
# The string is used as pattern on the name of switches on the
# Domoticz server. For example: if the switch for the corner
# lamp would be called 'corner_lamp' in Domoticz, the line 
# would be:
#
# corner;Lamp in the corner;domocorner_lamp
